# Scythe of the Doctor

_Melee Weapon; rare; requires attunement_

### Compact

- **Damage**: 1d4 S
- **Properties**: [Light](2.%20Mechanics/CLI/rules/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Cost**: ???
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

In compact form, the Scythe functions and appears as a mundane sickle, not displaying any magical properties. (A **Detect Magic** spell reveals the sickle to be shrouded in a veil of necrotic and transmutative magic.) The wielder must target the spell with a spell from the School of Necromancy; the sickle darkens as shadows coil around it and elongates into a massive two-handed scythe, with a blade that seems to drink in the light. Each time the scythe swings, the bell tolls faintly, as though death itself follows in its wake. Once the Scythe transforms this way, it remains in its expanded state for up to an hour or until dismissed as an action.

### Expanded

## Abilities

### Level 3+

- **Necrotic Infusion**: As a bonus action, you can infuse the Scythe with necrotic energy, adding 1d4 necrotic damage to your next successful attack. The extra damage increases by 1d4 at levels 5, 7, and 9.

### Level 5+

- **Death Toll**: When you score a critical hit with the Scythe, a ghostly tolling bell rings out, forcing all creatures within 10 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature is frightened until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected.

### Level 7+

- **Soul Harvest**: When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with the Scythe, you can use a reaction to capture its essence, expending 1 charge. Roll 1d8 to determine the effect:
    - **1-2**: Regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.
    - **3-4**: Gain advantage on all attack rolls until the end of your next turn.
    - **5**: Your next attack deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage before the end of your next turn.
    - **6**: You regain one expended spell slot no higher than your current level (rounded up)
    - **7**: You can make an additional melee attack against a creature within your reach. If this attack hits, you also regain hit points equal to the damage dealt.
    - **8**: The slain creature is raised as a [[zombie|Zombie]] on the start of its next turn. It obeys your command until destroyed (maximum of 1 hour) after which it crumbles into a heap of ash.

### Level 9+

- ### Reaper's Grasp

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can expend 1 charge to draw forth the lingering essence of the fallen soul. As you do, a ghostly silhouette of the creature manifests before you, flickering in and out of existence. Choose one creature within 30 feet; it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.

- **On a Failed Save:** The target is momentarily overcome by visions of their own mortality, taking **3d6 necrotic damage** and being frightened until the end of your next turn. If they drop to 0 hit points as a result of this damage, you can choose to imbue their essence into your scythe. For the next minute, your Scythe of the Doctor deals an additional **1d4 necrotic damage** with each successful hit.
    
- **On a Successful Save:** The target sees through the illusions, taking half the necrotic damage and shaking off the fear. However, if the target is reduced to 0 hit points from any source while frightened by this ability, they are consumed by shadows and cannot be raised from the dead for 1 week.
    

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
