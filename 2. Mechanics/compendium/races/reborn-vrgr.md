# Reborn

The Reborn lineage represents those who have experienced death but have been brought back to life by unnatural means. You retain vague memories of your past life, but you are something more (or less) than you were before. You might have come back from death through dark rituals, scientific methods, or a lingering connection to life, and this event has left you with unique traits.

## Ancestral Legacy

If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race:
- Any skill proficiencies you gained from it
- Any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it

If you don’t keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

## Deathless Nature

You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:
- **Advantage on Saving Throws** against disease and being poisoned, and you have resistance to poison damage.
- You have **advantage on Death Saving Throws**.
- You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.
- You don’t need to sleep, and magic can’t put you to sleep.
- You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.

## Knowledge from a Past Life

You temporarily remember sporadic glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from your previous life or cryptic knowledge from being returned to life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a d6 and add the number rolled to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

---

## Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.
