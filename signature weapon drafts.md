### **Coral Anchorblade**

_Melee Weapon (Quarterstaff); rare (requires attunement by a Druid)_


The **Coral Anchorblade** is a quarterstaff of driftwood, weathered by the salt and spray of the sea. When dormant, it appears mundane, though close inspection reveals faint traces of coral growth spiraling around the wood, as if the oceanâ€™s life itself clings to the staff.

When the druid wills it, the staff transforms in a breathtaking display: vibrant coral rapidly expands outward, encasing the wood as it twists and grows into the shape of a massive anchor. The anchor is adorned with living coral and barnacles, dripping with saltwater as though freshly pulled from the ocean depths. The coral glows faintly in dim light, its surface swirling with patterns of marine life.

The **Anchorblade** feels dense and powerful in hand, with the weight of the ocean behind it. As it swings through the air, it leaves behind a shimmering trail of water droplets, the distant sound of waves and rushing currents accompanying each strike.

### **Scaling Features**

#### **Level 3+**

- The Coral Anchorblade gains the **thrown** property (range 20/40 feet) when expanded and can be **recalled** as a bonus action.

#### **Level 5+**

- The Coral Anchorblade's expanded form now deals **3d4 bludgeoning damage**.
- The weapon gains **2 charges**, which are replenished daily at dawn.
- When the Anchorblade is thrown, you may expend **1 charge** to recall it in a **straight line** (5 feet wide). Any creature in the path must succeed on a **Dexterity saving throw** (DC equals your spell save DC) or take **2d4 bludgeoning damage**.

#### **Level 7+**

- The weapon's number of charges increases to **4**.
- If the Anchorblade misses its target when thrown, you may expend **2 charges** to strike the ground within 5 feet of the target. This releases a shockwave that forces creatures within a **15-foot cube** centered on you to make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC equals your spell save DC). On a failed save, a creature takes **2d8 thunder damage** and is either **pushed 10 feet** or **knocked prone** (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

#### **Level 10+**

- The Coral Anchorblade's expanded form now deals **3d6 bludgeoning damage**.
- The weapon's number of charges increases to **6**.

**Abyssal Current (3 charges)**: As a **bonus action**, you can slam the Anchorblade into the ground, creating a **30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide stream of rushing water**. The current persists for **1 minute**. Any creature that starts its turn within the stream or enters it for the first time on its turn must succeed on a **Strength saving throw** (DC equals your spell save DC) or be **swept 10 feet** in the direction of the current. You and your allies are unaffected and gain **10 feet of additional movement** while within the current.
