Colonies of Graevil

Life in the Colonies is not always easy. Each of the planets has its pitfalls, whether it is Shadowland with eternal night, forcing the inhabitants to live underground, Verdantia, whose wilderness is known only to local gnomes, naiads, and druids of strange plant origin, or Astralos, one of the largest planets of the Colonies, known for its technological development. But wherever the inhabitants of the Colonies live, they have one thing in common: they are trying to build a happy new life.

  

The name "Colonies of Graevil" is the collective name for several dozen planets where humanoid life has been found after a phenomenon called the Vacuum. These planets work together to arrange a decent life for all inhabitants and discover what has become of their lost past. Most planets are inhabited by humans, but dwarves, elementals, giants, elves, demons, angels and many more have their planets... the final number of inhabitants or planets is still unknown. Called Colonies for short, this space ecosystem officially falls under the rule of the uninhabitable planet Graevil.

The bustle of underground drilling echoes on Astralos even at night, desperate to extract enough resources to supply the Colonies' population. Docks for interplanetary vehicles are being built, though travelling in between planets is still out of reach for the average human. The pursuit of technological advancement is driven by a simple reason: the desire to keep the Colonies alive.

  

Technological progress in the Colonies varies from planet to planet. The planet Astralos has arguably the most densely populated planet in the entire Colonies, advanced technology, easy access to information, and the locals are mostly living the high life. However, other planets are only at the beginning of the technological age and others are almost untouched by technology. The colonies are, in a way, only just being colonised by the super planetary corporations that are the main link between planets. 

  

The processing and production of everything needed takes place on Astralos. There are factories processing raw materials, materials, fuel, energy, enviromental suits, spaceships, and medicine. Without these inventions, life on some planets would die out. On the other hand, Astral's mineral wealth is virtually zero, and without the supply of raw materials, life would end even faster than it began.

  

The planets need each other, and in order for them to join forces, there must be organisations and societies to enable them to do so. On most planets, you will find at least one factory of Stellarite Industries, an interplanetary company that provides coal and other combustion materials to create energy. Various subsidiaries of Stellarite ensure that life can thrive. For example, Stellarite Energy Fusion creates energy capsules, powering drilling engines. Stellarite Care develops medicine and vaccines. And Stellarite Research Institute tries to dig up buried knowledge of days past.

In between the heavy giants of mining cargo and transport ships, there are flashes of hyperspace engines. Those are the ships of bounty hunters, as they stalk the space and hunt down their targets. Their reward will be sweet, and their sense of satisfaction even greater.

  

Bounty Hunter Program a relatively new program designed to reduce crime and help out overwhelmed military. All you need to become a bounty hunter is a clean criminal record and your own spaceship. Although, the Guild based on Astralos will be more than happy to provide you one, even though for a fee. After all, there are not that many hunters, and if you're interested in joining, you can count on the Guild to help you out. The only condition is, each of the hunters need to meet a quota of caught bounties, otherwise their visa gets revoked.

  

For a small fee, a newly recruited hunter will be given an interplanetary visa that will allow them to visit any planet, and access the hunting network - simply referred as the Net. There, the hunter will receive information on possible bounties. The military uploads information about those perpetrators they cannot (or simply do not want to) search for. The hunter's task is simple. Bring the prey to the military station alive, as the hunters are given their general description and last known location. The reward depends on the profile of the prey; the more dangerous and desirable, the higher the reward and the higher the interest.

  

Hunters usually operate alone, though some of them joined forces and created their own groups, sharing the rewards among themselves. They often compete, but they don't go for each other's throats. Unless a hunter causes problems, it is virtually guaranteed that the authorities and the military will leave them alone. It's a lonely but, in a way, peaceful life for those dreaming of being able to fly wherever they pleases, living in their own spacecraft, and helping justice get the upper hand on the crooks.

When you switch on the radio, you can hear the Governor talking about the progress in restoring the Graevil’s surface. Some of the listeners look longingly to the sky in an attempt to see their new bright future, while others don’t even notice the Governor's voice, mistaking it for a communication noise. Once upon a time, thousands upon thousands of years ago, there was only one planet; larger than any of the current colonies. Graevil. Recent records of this planet speak of thriving societies of various races and species of animals and humanoids. Despite occasional disagreements and skirmishes, mainly due to the growing population, the society as a whole flourished and made its first space explorations. Interplanetary travel was at hand. 

  

Until the Vacuum arrived. An age of darkness, lost diaries, and forgotten memories. A time that never seemed to have happened, yet the evidence was there for all to see. During this period, Graevil became almost uninhabitable. Research by historians has shown that it was at least several hundred years of which people have no idea. All that remains are superstitions, legends, and myths; the mournful song of those who believe Graevil is irretrievably lost, the legend of the mysterious library that hides the secrets of the Vacuum in its dusty alleys, the myths of a mysterious power that haunts the descendants of its original inhabitants even today.
